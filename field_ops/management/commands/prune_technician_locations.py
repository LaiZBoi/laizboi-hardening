"""
Prune expired TechnicianLocation rows.

Phase 8.5 — runs nightly. Each ping has its `retention_until` pre-set on
insert; this command is a one-shot WHERE retention_until < today() so we
don't have to re-query the per-org policy.

Usage:
    python manage.py prune_technician_locations [--dry-run]
