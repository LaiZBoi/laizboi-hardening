"""
v3.17.245 — Phase 22 v1: email KB owners about overdue articles.

Run hourly / daily via cron. Idempotent: per-article reminders are
de-duplicated within a 7-day window via a session-style flag stored on
the article (`last_reminder_sent_at` is *not* a separate field — we
just look at last_reviewed_at + the cron's known frequency).

Usage:
    python manage.py kb_review_reminders [--dry-run]
